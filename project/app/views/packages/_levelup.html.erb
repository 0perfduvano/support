  <h2 class="intro">
    You should create an account. Here's why:
  </h2>

  <ul class="more">
    <li><strong>Add collections.</strong> More collections will be added in the future.
      You'll be able to customize them and pin the ones that matter to you most.</li>
    <li><strong>Pin packages.</strong> You could use your pinned packages as bookmarks or
      simply as a temporary stash area for your work in hand.</li>
    <li><strong>Create projects.</strong> You'll be able to upload a <code>package.json</code>
      file to filter out dependencies that are not met.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve the catalog.</strong> Logged in users can help fix packages mislabeled
      with the wrong collections.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="more">
    Some of these features are still being implemented, and therefore registrations are
    still closed. But I would love to hear your
    <a href="https://github.com/dmfrancisco/JS.coach">feedback</a>.
