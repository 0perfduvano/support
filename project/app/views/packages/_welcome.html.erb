    This is an opinionated catalog of open source JS packages.
  </h2>

  <p>Libraries come and go. The ecosystem evolves rapidly, and that's a good thing. But it
  means you can't rely on your bookmarks. Google may not be your best friend either, since
  it focuses on popular results â€” established solutions that may not be the best fit for your
  project.</p>

  <p>This website indexes new packages and is updated roughly once per day, by using both
  automated scripts and manual curation. It is a complete rewrite and grown-up version of
  <a href="https://github.com/madebyform/react-parts">React.parts</a>, a tiny project that
  started <%= relative_timestamp Date.new(2015,4,1) %>. Even if you are implementing your
  own solution for your particular problem, this can be a good place to find interesting code
  to learn from.</p>

  <p>I hope this catalog is as useful to you as it is to me.</p>
